ros2 topic list shows you the topics that are running in the script at that moment
to see the data you want to use ros2 topic echo "/name of topic" ex. ros2 topic echo /my_publisher for simple publisher

figure out how to use twist with linear and angular
you probably need to use the simple publisher and push the x,y,z values to the topic and then maybe the node does something with it idk

need to use two differnt python files(each node needs its own i think) https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Py-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html

*Robot Runs now
!The subscriber might not even be running still need to figure that out in the file with both pub and sub
!The publisher file also just runs the commands 
?Why?
TODO make the airtable link with and send data to either the publisher or Subscriber
* I still have a file for the subscriber that i will keep there and ill mkae a new file without them combined if i need to go back
